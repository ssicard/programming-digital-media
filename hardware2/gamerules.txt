Both players begin with their lights on. The goal is to "shoot", or press the
button, while the other person's light is on. If the other person is
successfully shot, meaning their light was on while the competing player clicked
their button, the competing player's led will flash five times to declare them
winner. If there are 3 misses, the player's gun is empty and the competitior
wins and thier LED will flash. 

Upon win, the winning player's LED will blink 5 times to represent the win.
